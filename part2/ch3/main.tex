\chapter{Uniform convergence}\label{ii:ch:3}

\begin{note}
  It turns out that there are several different concepts of convergence of functions;
  here we describe the two most important ones, \emph{pointwise convergence} and \emph{uniform convergence}.
  (There are other types of convergence for functions, such as \(L^1\) convergence, \(L^2\) convergence, convergence in measure, almost everywhere convergence, and so forth, but these are beyond the scope of this text.)
  The two notions are related, but not identical;
  the relationship between the two is somewhat analogous to the relationship between continuity and uniform continuity.
