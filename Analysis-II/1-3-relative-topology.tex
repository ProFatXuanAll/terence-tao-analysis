\section{Relative topology}\label{sec 1.3}

\begin{note}
    Consider the plane \(\mathbf{R}^2\) with the Euclidean metric \(d_{l^2}\).
    Inside the plane, we can ﬁnd the x-axis \(X \coloneqq \{(x, 0) : x \in \mathbf{R}\}\).
    The metric \(d_{l^2}\) can be restricted to \(X\), creating a subspace \((X, d_{l^2}|_{X \times X})\) of \((\mathbf{R}^2, d_{l^2})\).
    This subspace is essentially the same as the real line \((\mathbf{R}, d)\) with the usual metric;
    the precise way of stating this is that \((X, d_{l^2}|_{X \times X})\) is \emph{isometric} to \((\mathbf{R}, d)\).

\begin{definition}[Relative topology]\label{1.3.3}
    Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, let \(Y\) be a subset of \(X\), and let \(E\) be a subset of \(Y\).
    We say that \(E\) is \emph{relatively open with respect to \(Y\)} if it is open in the metric subspace \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\).
    Similarly, we say that \(E\) is \emph{relatively closed with respect to \(Y\)} if it is closed in the metric space \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{1.3.4}
    Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, let \(Y\) be a subset of \(X\), and let \(E\) be a subset of \(Y\).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(E\) is relatively open with respect to \(Y\) if and only if \(E = V \cap Y\) for some set \(V \subseteq X\) which is open in \(X\).
        \item \(E\) is relatively closed with respect to \(Y\) if and only if \(E = K \cap Y\) for some set \(K \subseteq X\) which is closed in \(X\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}{(a)}
    First suppose that \(E\) is relatively open with respect to \(Y\).
    Then, \(E\) is open in the metric space \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\).
    Thus, for every \(x \in E\), there exists a radius \(r > 0\) such that the ball \(B_{(Y, d|_{Y \times Y})}(x, r)\) is contained in \(E\).
    This radius \(r\) depends on \(x\);
    to emphasize this we write \(r_x\) instead of \(r\), thus for every \(x \in E\) the ball \(B_{(Y, d|_{Y \times Y})}(x, r_x)\) is contained in \(E\).
    (Note that we have used the axiom of choice to do this.)

    Now consider the set
    \[
        V \coloneqq \bigcup_{x \in E} B_{(X, d)}(x, r_x).
    \]
    This is a subset of \(X\).
    By Proposition \ref{1.2.15}(c) and (g), \(V\) is open.
    Now we prove that \(E = V \cap Y\).
    Certainly any point \(x\) in \(E\) lies in \(V \cap Y\), since it lies in \(Y\) and it also lies in \(B_{(X, d)}(x, r_x)\), and hence in \(V\).
    Now suppose that \(y\) is a point in \(V \cap Y\).
    Then \(y \in V\), which implies that there exists an \(x \in E\) such that \(y \in B_{(X, d)}(x, r_x)\).
    But since \(y\) is also in \(Y\) , this implies that \(y \in B_{(Y, d|_{Y \times Y})}(x, r_x)\).
    But by definition of \(r_x\), this means that \(y \in E\), as desired.
    Thus we have found an open set \(V\) for which \(E = V \cap Y\) as desired.

    Now we do the converse.
    Suppose that \(E = V \cap Y\) for some open set \(V\);
    we have to show that \(E\) is relatively open with respect to \(Y\).
    Let \(x\) be any point in \(E\);
    we have to show that \(x\) is an interior point of \(E\) in the metric space \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\).
    Since \(x \in E\), we know \(x \in V\).
    Since \(V\) is open in \(X\), we know that there is a radius \(r > 0\) such that \(B_{(X, d)}(x, r)\) is contained in \(V\).
    Strictly speaking, \(r\) depends on \(x\), and so we could write \(r_x\) instead of \(r\), but for this argument we will only use a single choice of \(x\) (as opposed to the argument in the previous paragraph) and so we will not bother to subscript \(r\) here.
    Since \(E = V \cap Y\), this means that \(B_{(X, d)}(x, r) \cap Y\) is contained in \(E\).
    But \(B_{(X, d)}(x, r) \cap Y\) is exactly the same as \(B_{(Y, d|_{Y \times Y})}(x, r)\), and so \(B_{(Y, d|_{Y \times Y})}(x, r)\) is contained in \(E\).
    Thus \(x\) is an interior point of \(E\) in the metric space \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\), as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}{(b)}
    First suppose that \(E\) is relatively closed with respect to \(Y\).
    Then by Definition \ref{1.3.3} \(E\) is closed in the metric space \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\).
    By Proposition \ref{1.2.15}(e) \(Y \setminus E\) is open in the metric space \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\).
    By Proposition \ref{1.3.4}(a) we know that \(Y \setminus E = V \cap Y\) for some set \(V \subseteq X\) which is open in the metric space \((X, d)\).
    Let \(K = X \setminus V\).
    By Proposition \ref{1.2.15}(e) we know that \(K\) is closed in the metric space \((X, d)\).
    Then we have
    \begin{align*}
        K \cap Y & = (X \setminus V) \cap Y          \\
                 & = (X \cap Y) \setminus (V \cap Y) \\
                 & = Y \setminus (V \cap Y)          \\
                 & = Y \setminus (Y \setminus E)     \\
                 & = E.
    \end{align*}

    Now suppose that \(E = K \cap Y\) for some set \(K \subseteq X\) which is closed in the metric space \((X, d)\).
    Then by Proposition \ref{1.2.15}(e) \(X \setminus K\) is open in the metric space \((X, d)\).
    By Proposition \ref{1.3.4}(a) we know that \(F = (X \setminus K) \cap Y\) is relatively open with respect to \(Y\).
    Then by Proposition \ref{1.2.15}(e) \(Y \setminus F\) is relatively closed with respect to \(Y\) and
    \begin{align*}
        Y \setminus F & = Y \setminus \big((X \setminus K) \cap Y\big)          \\
                      & = Y \setminus \big((X \cap Y) \setminus (K \cap Y)\big) \\
                      & = Y \setminus \big(Y \setminus (K \cap Y)\big)          \\
                      & = Y \setminus (Y \setminus E)                           \\
                      & = E.
    \end{align*}
