# Terence Tao Analysis

These are my notes on the book **Analysis I** and **Analysis II**, 3rd edition, written by Terence Tao.
My notes cover statements I found important or interesting, including almost all axioms, corollaries, exercises, lemmata, proofs, propositions, remarks, and theories in both books.
Errata on Tao's website ([Analysis-I](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-i) and [Analysis-II](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-ii)) are covered.
I have written proofs for exercises, most of which cannot be completed without referencing solutions from online forums.
So, many thanks to the people who provided solutions at [math.stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com), and [taoanalysis.wordpress.com](https://taoanalysis.wordpress.com), to name a few.

## Compile to PDF

I use vscode extenstion `latex-workshop` and I build the `main.tex` file using the default recipe.
Note that one have to install [texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) before compile tex files (official installation is recommended).

## Contribution

### Issues

I do not have a mathematical background.
This means my proofs can be non-rigorous and may have plenty of flaws.
Any helps are appreciated, especially for the followings:

- Correction on **syntax** and **grammar**.
- Making **proofs** more **rigorous**.
- Finishing **proofs** that I am struggled with.

Please **fork** the repository and submit a **pull request**, or just open **issues** and I will response ASAP.

### Formatting

Tex files are linted by `latexindent`.
