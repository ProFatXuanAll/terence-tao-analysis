# Terence Tao Analysis

This repo contains notes of the following textbooks:

- Analysis I 3rd edition by Terence Tao.
- Analysis II 3rd edition by Terence Tao.

The notes cover almost all exercises appear in the textbooks, which are copied from the books, with or without some modifications.
The notes also have some additional corollaries to help proving others.

Errata provided on Tao's website are applied.
See [Analysis-I errata](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-i/) and [Analysis-II errata](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-ii/) for ettata details.

## Compile to PDF

I use vscode extenstion `latex-workshop` and I build the `main.tex` file using the default recipe.

## Contribution

### Issues

I do not have mathematical background, and this means my proofs can be non-rigorous and have plenty of flaws.
Any helps are appreciated, especially for the followings:

- **Syntax** and **grammar** correction.
- Making **proofs** more **rigorous**.
- **Proofs** I am struggled with.

Please **fork** the repository and submit a **pull request**, or just open **issues** and I will response ASAP.

### Style Rules

Tex codes are linted by `latexindent`.
