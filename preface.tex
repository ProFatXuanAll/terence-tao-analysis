\chapter*{Preface}

These are my notes on the book ``Analysis I'' and ``Analysis II,'' 3rd edition, written by Terence Tao.
My notes cover statements I found important or interesting, including almost all axioms, corollaries, exercises, lemmata, proofs, propositions, remarks, and theories in both books.
Errata on Tao's website (\url{https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-i} and \url{https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-ii}) are covered.
I have written proofs for exercises, most of which cannot be completed without referencing solutions from online forums.
So, many thanks to the people who provided solutions at \url{https://math.stackexchange.com}, and \url{https://taoanalysis.wordpress.com}, to name a few.

I wrap statements inside a \LaTeX\ environment.
I have written some ``additional corollaries,'' which help prove complex statements.
The following table provides the mapping between the typeset (name) and the meaning of each environment.
