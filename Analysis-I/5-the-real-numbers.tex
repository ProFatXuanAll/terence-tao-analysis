\chapter{The real numbers}\label{ch:5}

\begin{note}
  We defined the natural numbers using the five Peano axioms, and postulated that such a number system existed;
  this is plausible, since the natural numbers correspond to the very intuitive and fundamental notion of \emph{sequential counting}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The symbols \(\N\), \(\Q\), and \(\R\) stand for ``natural'', ``quotient'', and ``real'' respectively.
  \(\Z\) stands for ``Zahlen'', the German word for numbers.
  There is also the \emph{complex numbers} \(\C\), which obviously stands for ``complex''.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \emph{Formal} means ``having the form of'';
  at the beginning of our construction the expression \(a \text{---} b\) did not actually \emph{mean} the difference \(a - b\), since the symbol \text{---} was meaningless.
  It only had the \emph{form} of a difference.
  Later on we defined subtraction and verified that the formal difference was equal to the actual difference, so this eventually became a non-issue, and our symbol for formal differencing was discarded.
  Somewhat confusingly, this use of the term ``formal'' is unrelated to the notions of a formal argument and an informal argument.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  There is a fundamental area of mathematics where the rational number system does not suffice - that of \emph{geometry}
  (the study of lengths, areas, etc.).
  For instance, a right-angled triangle with both sides equal to \(1\) gives a hypotenuse of \(\sqrt{2}\), which is an \emph{irrational} number, i.e., not a rational number;
  see \cref{4.4.4}.
  Things get even worse when one starts to deal with the sub-field of geometry known as \emph{trigonometry}, when one sees numbers such as \(\pi\) or \(\cos(1)\), which turn out to be in some sense ``even more'' irrational than \(\sqrt{2}\).
  (These numbers are known as \emph{transcendental numbers}, but to discuss this further would be far beyond the scope of this text.)
  Thus, in order to have a number system which can adequately describe geometry
  - or even something as simple as measuring lengths on a line
  - one needs to replace the rational number system with the real number system.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  In the constructions of integers and rationals, the task was to introduce one more \emph{algebraic} operation to the number system
  - e.g., one can get integers from naturals by introducing subtraction, and get the rationals from the integers by introducing division.
  But to get the reals from the rationals is to pass from a ``discrete'' system to a ``continuous'' one, and requires the introduction of a somewhat different notion
  - that of a \emph{limit}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The limit is a concept which on one level is quite intuitive, but to pin down rigorously turns out to be quite difficult.
  (Even such great mathematicians as Euler and Newton had difficulty with this concept.
  It was only in the nineteenth century that mathematicians such as Cauchy and Dedekind figured out how to deal with limits rigorously.)
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The procedure we give here of obtaining the real numbers as the limit of sequences of rational numbers may seem rather complicated.
  However, it is in fact an instance of a very general and useful procedure, that of \emph{completing} one metric space to form another.
