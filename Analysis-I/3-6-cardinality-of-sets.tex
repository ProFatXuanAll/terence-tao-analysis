\section{Cardinality of sets}\label{sec:3.6}

\begin{note}
	In \cref{ch:2} we defined the natural numbers axiomatically, assuming that they were equipped with a \(0\) and an increment operation, and assuming five axioms on these numbers.
	Philosophically, this is quite different from one of our main conceptualizations of natural numbers
	- that of \emph{cardinality}, or measuring \emph{how many} elements there are in a set.
	Indeed, the Peano axiom approach treats natural numbers more like \emph{ordinals} than \emph{cardinals}.
	(The \emph{cardinals} are One, Two, Three, ..., and are used to count how many things there are in a set.
	The \emph{ordinals} are First, Second, Third, ..., and are used to order a sequence of objects.
	There is a subtle difference between the two, especially when comparing infinite cardinals with infinite ordinals, but this is beyond the scope of this text.)
	We paid a lot of attention to what number came \emph{next} after a given number \(n\)
	- which is an operation which is quite natural for ordinals, but less so for cardinals
	- but did not address the issue of whether these numbers could be used to \emph{count} sets.
	The purpose of \cref{sec:3.6} is to address this issue by noting that the natural numbers \emph{can} be used to count the cardinality of sets, as long as the set is finite.

	One way to define cardinality is to say that two sets have the same size if they have the same number of elements, but we have not yet defined what the ``number of elements'' in a set is.
	Besides, this runs into problems when a set is infinite.

	The right way to define the concept of ``two sets having the same size'' is not immediately obvious, but can be worked out with some thought.
	One intuitive reason why two sets have the same size is that one can match the elements of the first set with the elements in the second set in a one-to-one correspondence
	(Indeed, this is how we first learn to count a set:
	we correspond the set we are trying to count with another set, such as a set of fingers on your hand).
	We will use this intuitive understanding as our rigorous basis for ``having the same size''.
\end{note}

\begin{defn}[Equal cardinality]\label{3.6.1}
	We say that two sets \(X\) and \(Y\) have \emph{equal cardinality} iff there exists a bijection \(f : X \to Y\) from \(X\) to \(Y\).
\end{defn}

\setcounter{thm}{2}
\begin{rmk}\label{3.6.3}
	The fact that two sets have equal cardinality does not preclude one of the sets from containing the other.
	For instance, if \(X\) is the set of natural numbers and \(Y\) is the set of even natural numbers, then the map \(f : X \to Y\) defined by \(f(n) \coloneqq 2n\) is a bijection from \(X\) to \(Y\), and so \(X\) and \(Y\) have equal cardinality, despite \(Y\) being a subset of \(X\) and seeming intuitively as if it should only have ``half'' of the elements of \(X\).
\end{rmk}

\begin{prop}\label{3.6.4}
	Let \(X\), \(Y\), \(Z\) be sets.
	Then \(X\) has equal cardinality with \(X\).
	If \(X\) has equal cardinality with \(Y\), then \(Y\) has equal cardinality with \(X\).
	If \(X\) has equal cardinality with \(Y\) and \(Y\) has equal cardinality with \(Z\), then \(X\) has equal cardinality with \(Z\).
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}[\pf{3.6.4}]
	We first show that \cref{3.6.1} is reflexive.
	Let \(f : X \to X\) be a function where \(f = x \mapsto x\).
	By \cref{3.6} \(f\) is well-defined.
	Since
	\[
		\forall x_1, x_2 \in X, x_1 \neq x_2 \implies x_1 = f(x_1) \neq f(x_2) = x_2,
	\]
	by \cref{3.3.14} we know that \(f\) is injective.
	Since
	\[
		\forall x \in X, f(x) = x,
	\]
	by \cref{3.3.17} we know that \(f\) is surjective.
	Thus by \cref{3.3.20} \(f\) is bijective, and by \cref{3.6.1} \(X\) has equal cardinality with \(X\).

	Next we show that \cref{3.6.1} is symmetric.
	Suppose that \(X\) has equal cardinality with \(Y\).
	Then by \cref{3.6.1} there exists a bijective function \(f : X \to Y\).
	Since \(f\) is bijective, by \cref{ex:3.3.6} we know that \(f^{-1} : Y \to X\) is also bijective.
	Thus by \cref{3.6.1} \(Y\) has equal cardinality with \(X\).

	Finally we show that \cref{3.6.1} is transitive.
	Suppose that \(X\) has equal cardinality with \(Y\) and \(Y\) has equal cardinality with \(Z\).
	Then by \cref{3.6.1} there exist two bijective functions \(f : X \to Y\) and \(g : Y \to Z\).
	Since \(f\) and \(g\) are bijective, by \cref{ex:3.3.7} we know that \(g \circ f : X \to Z\) is also bijective.
	Thus by \cref{3.6.1} \(X\) has equal cardinality with \(Z\).
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}\label{3.6.5}
	Let \(n\) be a natural number.
	A set \(X\) is said to have \emph{cardinality} \(n\), iff it has equal cardinality with \(\set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n}\).
	We also say that \(X\) \emph{has \(n\) elements} iff it has cardinality \(n\).
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk}\label{3.6.6}
	One can use the set \(\set{i \in \N : i < n}\) instead of \(\set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n}\), since these two sets clearly have equal cardinality.
\end{rmk}

\begin{proof}[\pf{3.6.6}]
	Let \(A = \set{i \in \N : i < n}\) and let \(B = \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n}\).
	Let \(f : A \to B\) be the function defined by \(f = n \mapsto n\pp\).
	By \cref{2.4,3.3.14} we see that \(f\) is injective.
	Since \(0 \notin B\), by \cref{2.2.10} we know that for every \(i \in B\), there exists an \(j \in \N\) such that \(j\pp = i\).
	Then we have
	\begin{align*}
		         & i \in B                             \\
		\implies & j\pp = i \leq n &  & \by{3.5}       \\
		\implies & j < n           &  & \by{2.2.12}[e] \\
		\implies & j \in A.        &  & \by{3.5}
	\end{align*}
	Thus \(f(j)\) is well-defined by \cref{3.3.1} and \(f(j) = j\pp = i\).
	By \cref{3.3.17} this means \(f\) is surjective.
	Since \(f\) is both injective and surjective, by \cref{3.3.20} we know that \(f\) is bijective.
	Thus by \cref{3.6.1} \(A, B\) have equal cardinality.
\end{proof}

\setcounter{thm}{7}
\begin{prop}[Uniqueness of cardinality]\label{3.6.8}
	Let \(X\) be a set with some cardinality \(n\).
	Then \(X\) cannot have any other cardinality, i.e., \(X\) cannot have cardinality \(m\) for any \(m \neq n\).
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}[\pf{3.6.8}]
	We induct on \(n\).
	First suppose that \(n = 0\).
	Then \(X\) must be empty (\cref{ex:3.3.3}), and so \(X\) cannot have any non-zero cardinality.
	Now suppose that the proposition is already proven for some \(n\);
	we now prove it for \(n\pp\).
	Let \(X\) have cardinality \(n\pp\);
	and suppose that \(X\) also has some other cardinality \(m \neq n\pp\).
	By \cref{2.2.10} there exists a \(p \in \N\) such that \(p\pp = m\).
	By \cref{3.6.9}, \(X\) is non-empty, and if \(x\) is any element of \(X\), then \(X \setminus \set{x}\) has cardinality \(n\) and also has cardinality \(p\), by \cref{3.6.9}.
	By induction hypothesis, this means that \(n = p\), which implies that \(p\pp = m = n\pp\), a contradiction.
	This closes the induction.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{3.6.9}
	Let \(X\) be a set with cardinality \(n \geq 1\).
	Then \(X\) is non-empty, and if \(x\) is any element of \(X\), then the set \(X \setminus \set{x}\) (i.e., \(X\) with the element \(x\) removed) has cardinality \(m\), where \(m\pp = n\).
	(Such \(m\) exists by \cref{2.2.10}.)
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}[\pf{3.6.9}]
	If \(X\) is empty then it clearly cannot have the same cardinality as the non-empty set \(\set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n}\), as there is no bijection from the empty set to a non-empty set (\cref{ex:3.3.3}).
	Now let \(x\) be an element of \(X\).
	Since \(X\) has the same cardinality as \(\set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n}\) (\cref{3.6.5}), we thus have a bijection \(f\) from \(X\) to \(\set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n}\).
	In particular, \(f(x)\) is a natural number between \(1\) and \(n\).
	Now define the function \(g : X \setminus \set{x} \to \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq m}\) by the following rule:
	\[
		\forall y \in X \setminus \set{x}, g(y) \coloneqq \begin{dcases}
			f(y) & \text{if } f(y) < f(x)                          \\
			k    & \text{if } f(y) > f(x) \text{ and } k\pp = f(y)
		\end{dcases}.
	\]
	Note that \(f(y)\) cannot equal \(f(x)\) since \(y \neq x\) and \(f\) is a bijection.
	Also note that since \(f(y) \geq 1\), \(k\) is well-defined by \cref{2.2.10}.

	We show that \(g\) is injective.
	Let \(y_1, y_2 \in X \setminus \set{x}\) and \(y_1 \neq y_2\).
	Now we split into four cases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If \(f(y_1) < f(x)\) and \(f(y_2) < f(x)\), then \(g(y_1) = f(y_1) \neq f(y_2) = g(y_2)\) since \(f\) is bijective.
		\item If \(f(y_1) < f(x)\) and \(f(y_2) > f(x)\), then there exists a \(k \in \N\) such that \(k\pp = f(y_2)\).
		      Thus we have
		      \begin{align*}
			               & g(y_1) = f(y_1) < f(x) < f(y_2) = k\pp                              \\
			      \implies & g(y_1) < f(x) < f(x)\pp \leq k\pp      &  & \by{ac:2.2.3,2.2.12}[e] \\
			      \implies & g(y_1) < f(x) \leq k = g(y_2)          &  & \by{2.2.12}[d]          \\
			      \implies & g(y_1) < g(y_2).                       &  & \by{2.2.12}[b]
		      \end{align*}
		      In particular we have \(g(y_1) \neq g(y_2)\) by \cref{2.2.13}.
		\item If \(f(y_1) > f(x)\) and \(f(y_2) < f(x)\), then we can use the second case and switch the role of \(f(y_1)\) and \(f(y_2)\) to derive \(g(y_2) \neq g(y_1)\).
		\item If \(f(y_1) > f(x)\) and \(f(y_2) > f(x)\), then there exist some \(k_1, k_2 \in \N\) such that \(k_1\pp = f(y_1)\) and \(k_2\pp = f(y_2)\).
		      Since \(f\) is bijective, we must have \(f(y_1) \neq f(y_2)\).
		      Therefore by \cref{2.4} we have \(g(y_1) = k_1 \neq k_2 = g(y_2)\).
	\end{itemize}
	From all cases above we see that \(g(y_1) \neq g(y_2)\).
	Therefore by \cref{3.3.14} \(g\) is injective.

	Next we show that \(g\) is surjective.
	Let \(i \in \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq m}\).
	Since \(f\) is bijective and \(i \leq m < n\), we know that \(f^{-1}(i) \in X\) is well-defined.
	Now we split into two cases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If \(1 \leq i < f(x)\), then we have \(f^{-1}(i) \neq f^{-1}(f(x)) = x\) since \(f\) is bijective.
		      Thus by \cref{3.1.27} we have \(f^{-1}(i) \in X \setminus \set{x}\).
		      By \cref{3.3.1} we know that \(g\pa{f^{-1}(i)}\) is well-defined and by the definition of \(g\) we have \(i = f\pa{f^{-1}(i)} < f(x) \implies g\pa{f^{-1}(i)} = f\pa{f^{-1}(i)} = i\).
		      Thus we have found some \(y \in X \setminus \set{x}\) such that \(g(y) = i\).
		\item If \(f(x) \leq i \leq m\), then by \cref{2.2.12}(d)(e) we have \(f(x) < i\pp \leq m\pp = n\).
		      Since \(f\) is bijective, we know that \(f^{-1}(i\pp)\) is well-defined and \(f(x) \neq i\pp \implies f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \neq f^{-1}(i\pp)\).
		      Thus by \cref{3.1.27} we have \(f^{-1}(i\pp) \in X \setminus \set{x}\).
		      By \cref{3.3.1} we know that \(g\pa{f^{-1}(i\pp)}\) is well-defined and by the definition of \(g\) we have \(i\pp = f\pa{f^{-1}(i\pp)} > f(x) \implies g\pa{f^{-1}(i\pp)} = i\).
		      Thus we have found some \(y \in X \setminus \set{x}\) such that \(g(y) = i\).
	\end{itemize}
	From all cases above we see that there exists a \(y \in X \setminus \set{x}\) such that \(g(y) = i\).
	Therefore by \cref{3.3.17} \(g\) is surjective.
	Since \(g\) is both injective and surjective, by \cref{3.3.20} we know that \(g\) is bijective.

	By \cref{3.6.5} this means \(X \setminus \set{x}\) has equal cardinality with \(\set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq m}\).
	In particular \(X \setminus \set{x}\) has cardinality \(m\), as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}[Finite sets]\label{3.6.10}
	A set is \emph{finite} iff it has cardinality \(n\) for some natural number \(n\);
	otherwise, the set is called \emph{infinite}.
	If \(X\) is a finite set, we use \(\#(X)\) to denote the cardinality of \(X\).
\end{defn}

\setcounter{thm}{11}
\begin{thm}\label{3.6.12}
	The set of natural numbers \(\N\) is infinite.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[\pf{3.6.12}]
	Suppose for sake of contradiction that the set of natural numbers \(\N\) was finite, so it had some cardinality \(\#(\N) = n\).
	Then there is a bijection \(f\) from \(\set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n}\) to \(\N\).
	One can show that the sequence \(f(1), f(2), \dots, f(n)\) is bounded, or more precisely that there exists a natural number \(M\) such that \(f(i) \leq M\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\) (\cref{ex:3.6.3}).
	But then the natural number \(M+1\) is not equal to any of the \(f(i)\), contradicting the hypothesis that \(f\) is a bijection.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}\label{3.6.13}
	One can also use similar arguments to show that any unbounded set is infinite;
	for instance the rationals \(\Q\) and the reals \(\R\) are infinite.
	However, it is possible for some sets to be ``more'' infinite than others.
	See \cref{sec:8.3}.
\end{rmk}

\begin{prop}[Cardinal arithmetic]\label{3.6.14}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Let \(X\) be a finite set, and let \(x\) be an object which is not an element of \(X\).
		      Then \(X \cup \set{x}\) is finite and \(\#(X \cup \set{x}) = \#(X) + 1\).
		\item Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be finite sets.
		      Then \(X \cup Y\) is finite and \(\#(X \cup Y) \leq \#(X) + \#(Y)\).
		      If in addition \(X\) and \(Y\) are disjoint (i.e., \(X \cap Y = \emptyset\)), then \(\#(X \cup Y) = \#(X) + \#(Y)\).
		\item Let \(X\) be a finite set, and let \(Y\) be a subset of \(X\).
		      Then \(Y\) is finite, and \(\#(Y) \leq \#(X)\).
		      If in addition \(Y \neq X\) (i.e., \(Y\) is a proper subset of \(X\)), then we have \(\#(Y) < \#(X)\).
		\item If \(X\) is a finite set, and \(f : X \to Y\) is a function, then \(f(X)\) is a finite set with \(\#(f(X)) \leq \#(X)\).
		      If in addition \(f\) is one-to-one, then \(\#(f(X)) = \#(X)\).
		\item Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be finite sets.
		      Then Cartesian product \(X \times Y\) is finite and \(\#(X \times Y) = \#(X) \times \#(Y)\).
		\item Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be finite sets.
		      Then the set \(Y^X\) (defined in \cref{3.10}) is finite and \(\#\pa{Y^X} = \#(Y)^{\#(X)}\).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}[\pf{3.6.14}(a)]
	Since \(X\) is finite, by \cref{3.6.10} there exists an \(n \in \N\) such that \(\#(X) = n\).
	By \cref{3.6.5} there exists a bijective function \(f : X \to \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n}\).
	Now we define a function \(g : X \cup \set{x} \to \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n + 1}\) as follow:
	\[
		\forall y \in X \cup \set{x}, g(y) = \begin{dcases}
			f(y)  & \text{if } y \neq x \\
			n + 1 & \text{if } y = x
		\end{dcases}.
	\]
	Since \(x \notin X\), we see that \(g\) passes the vertical line test and therefore \(g\) is well-defined.

	Now we claim that \(g\) is bijective.
	Since \(f\) is bijective, we know that for all \(j \in \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n}\), there exists a \(y \in X\) such that \(f(y) = j\).
	With that and \(g(x) = n + 1\), we see that \(g\) is surjective by \cref{3.3.17}.
	To show that \(g\) is bijective, by \cref{3.3.20} we also need to show that \(g\) is injective.
	So let \(y, y' \in X \cup \set{x}\) and \(y \neq y'\).
	Now we split into three cases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If \(y \neq x \neq y'\), then we have \(g(y) = f(y) \neq f(y') = g(y')\) since \(f\) is bijective.
		\item If \(y \neq x = y'\), then by \cref{ac:2.2.3} we have \(g(y) = f(y) \leq n < n + 1 = g(x) = g(y')\).
		      By \cref{2.2.13} this means \(g(y) \neq g(y')\).
		\item If \(y = x \neq y'\), then by \cref{ac:2.2.3} we have \(g(y') = f(y') \leq n < n + 1 = g(x) = g(y)\).
		      By \cref{2.2.13} this means \(g(y) \neq g(y')\).
	\end{itemize}
	For all cases above we have \(g(y) \neq g(y')\), thus by \cref{3.3.14} \(g\) is injective.
	This means \(g\) is bijective, therefore by \cref{3.6.10} we know that \(X \cup \set{x}\) is finite and \(\#(X \cup \set{x}) = n + 1 = \#(X) + 1\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[\pf{3.6.14}(b)]
	Since \(X\) is finite, by \cref{3.6.10} there exists an \(n \in \N\) such that \(\#(X) = n\).
	We induct on \(n\) to show that \(X \cup Y\) is finite and \(\#(X \cup Y) \leq \#(X) + \#(Y)\).
	For \(n = 0\), by \cref{ex:3.6.2} we have \(X = \emptyset\).
	By \cref{3.1.28}(a) we have \(\emptyset \cup Y = Y\).
	Since \(Y\) is finite, we know that \(\emptyset \cup Y\) is finite.
	Thus we have
	\begin{align*}
		\#(\emptyset \cup Y) & = \#(Y)                  &  & \by{3.1.28}[a] \\
		                     & = 0 + \#(Y)              &  & \by{2.2.1}     \\
		                     & = \#(\emptyset) + \#(Y). &  & \by{ex:3.6.2}
	\end{align*}
	So the base case holds.
	Suppose inductively that \(X \cup Y\) is finite and \(\#(X \cup Y) \leq \#(X) + \#(Y)\) for some \(\#(X) = n\).
	We want to show that when \(\#(X) = n\pp\), we have \(X \cup Y\) is finite and \(\#(X \cup Y) \leq \#(X) + \#(Y)\).
	So let \(X\) be a set with cardinality \(n\pp\).
	We split into two cases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If \(X \setminus Y = \emptyset\), then we have
		      \begin{align*}
			      X \cup Y & = (X \setminus Y) \cup (X \cap Y) \cup (Y \setminus X) &  & \by{ex:3.1.10} \\
			               & = (X \cap Y) \cup (Y \setminus X)                      &  & \by{3.1.28}[a] \\
			               & \subseteq Y.                                           &  & \by{3.1.15}
		      \end{align*}
		      But by \cref{ex:3.1.7} we have \(Y \subseteq X \cup Y\).
		      Thus by \cref{3.1.18} we have \(X \cup Y = Y\).
		      Since \(Y\) is finite, \(X \cup Y\) is also finite.
		      By \cref{2.2.11} this means \(\#(X \cup Y) = \#(Y) \leq \#(X) + \#(Y)\).
		\item If \(X \setminus Y \neq \emptyset\), then by \cref{3.1.6,3.1.27} there exists a \(z \in X\) such that \(z \notin Y\).
		      This implies \((X \setminus \set{z}) \cup Y = (X \cup Y) \setminus \set{z}\).
		      By \cref{3.6.9} we know that \(\#(X \setminus \set{z}) = n\), thus by induction hypothesis we know that \((X \setminus \set{z}) \cup Y\) is finite and \(\#((X \setminus \set{z}) \cup Y) \leq \#(X \setminus \set{z}) + \#(Y)\).
		      By \cref{3.6.14}(a) we know that \(X \cup Y = (X \setminus \set{z}) \cup Y \cup \set{z}\) is finite.
		      Thus we have
		      \begin{align*}
			      \#(X \cup Y) & = \#(((X \cup Y) \setminus \set{z}) \cup \set{z}) &  & \by{3.1.28}[e] \\
			                   & = \#(((X \setminus \set{z}) \cup Y) \cup \set{z}) &  & \by{3.1.28}[e] \\
			                   & = \#((X \setminus \set{z}) \cup Y) + 1            &  & \by{3.6.14}[a] \\

			                   & = \#((X \setminus \set{z}) \cup \set{z}) + \#(Y)  &  & \by{3.6.14}[a] \\
			                   & = \#(X) + \#(Y).                                  &  & \by{3.1.28}[e]
		      \end{align*}
	\end{itemize}
	From all cases above we see that \(X \cup Y\) is finite and \(\#(X \cup Y) \leq \#(X) + \#(Y)\).
	This closes the induction.

	Now we show that \(X \cap Y = \emptyset \implies \#(X \cup Y) = \#(X) + \#(Y)\).
	So suppose that \(X \cap Y = \emptyset\).
	Since \(X, Y\) are finite, by \cref{3.6.5} there exist two bijective functions \(f : X \to \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq \#(X)}\) and \(g : Y \to \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq \#(Y)}\).
	Now we define a function \(h : X \cup Y \to \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq \#(X) + \#(Y)}\) as follow:
	\[
		\forall z \in X \cup Y, h(z) = \begin{dcases}
			f(z)         & \text{if } z \in X \\
			g(z) + \#(X) & \text{if } z \in Y
		\end{dcases}.
	\]
	Since \(X \cap Y = \emptyset\), we know that \(h\) passes the vertical line test, therefore \(h\) is well-defined.
	We claim that \(h\) is injective.
	So let \(z_1, z_2 \in X \cup Y\) and \(z_1 \neq z_2\).
	Since \(X \cap Y = \emptyset\), we know that \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) can be either in \(X\) or \(Y\) but not both.
	Thus we can split into four cases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If both \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) are in \(X\), then we have \(h(z_1) = f(z_1) \neq f(z_2) = h(z_2)\) since \(f\) is bijective.
		\item If both \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) are in \(Y\), then we have \(g(z_1) \neq g(z_2)\) since \(g\) is bijective.
		      By \cref{2.2.13} this means \(g(z_1) < g(z_2)\) or \(g(z_1) > g(z_2)\), thus we can apply \cref{2.2.12}(d) to derive \(g(z_1) + \#(X) < g(z_2) + \#(X)\) or \(g(z_1) + \#(X) > g(z_2) + \#(X)\).
		      By \cref{2.2.13} again we have \(h(z_1) = g(z_1) + \#(X) \neq g(z_2) + \#(X) = h(z_2)\).
		\item If \(z_1 \in X\) and \(z_2 \in Y\), then by \cref{ac:2.2.3} and \cref{2.2.12}(b)(d) we have
		      \[
			      1 \leq h(z_1) = f(z_1) \leq \#(X) < \#(X) + 1 \leq h(z_2) = g(z_2) + \#(X) \leq \#(X) + \#(Y).
		      \]
		      By \cref{2.2.13} this means \(h(z_1) \neq h(z_2)\).
		\item If \(z_1 \in Y\) and \(z_2 \in X\), then by \cref{ac:2.2.3} and \cref{2.2.12}(b)(d) we have
		      \[
			      1 \leq h(z_2) = f(z_2) \leq \#(X) < \#(X) + 1 \leq h(z_1) = g(z_1) + \#(X) \leq \#(X) + \#(Y).
		      \]
		      By \cref{2.2.13} this means \(h(z_1) \neq h(z_2)\).
	\end{itemize}
	From all cases above we see that \(h(z_1) \neq h(z_2)\).
	Therefore \(h\) is injective.
	Now we claim that \(h\) is surjective.
	Let \(j \in \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq \#(X) + \#(Y)}\).
	We split into two cases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If \(1 \leq j \leq \#(X)\), then there exists a \(z \in X\) such that \(f(z) = j\).
		      This is true since \(f\) is bijective.
		      By the definition of \(h\) we know that \(h(z) = f(z) = j\).
		      Thus we conclude that there exists a \(z \in X \cup Y\) such that \(h(z) = j\).
		\item If \(\#(X) + 1 \leq j \leq \#(X) + \#(Y)\), then by \cref{2.2.11} we have \(j = \#(X) + 1 + k\) for some \(k \in \N\).
		      By \cref{2.2.12}(d) we know that \(\#(X) + 1 \leq \#(X) + 1 + k \leq \#(X) + \#(Y) \implies 1 \leq 1 + k \leq \#(Y)\).
		      Thus there exists a \(z \in Y\) such that \(g(z) = 1 + k\) since \(g\) is bijective.
		      By the definition of \(h\) we know that \(h(z) = g(z) + \#(X) = k + 1 + \#(X) = j\).
		      Thus we conclude that there exists a \(z \in X \cup Y\) such that \(h(z) = j\).
	\end{itemize}
	From all cases above we conclude that there exists a \(z \in X \cup Y\) such that \(h(z) = j\).
	Thus \(h\) is surjective.
	Since \(h\) is both injective and surjective, by \cref{3.3.20} we know that \(h\) is bijective.
	By \cref{3.6.5} this means \(X \cup Y\) has cardinality \(\#(X) + \#(Y)\).
	Thus by \cref{3.6.10} we have \(\#(X \cup Y) = \#(X) + \#(Y)\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[\pf{3.6.14}(c)]
	Since \(X\) is finite, by \cref{3.6.10} there exists an \(n \in \N\) such that \(\#(X) = n\).
	We induct on \(n\) to show that any subset \(Y\) of \(X\) is finite and \(\#(Y) \leq \#(X)\).
	For \(n = 0\), by \cref{ex:3.6.2} we have \(X = \emptyset\).
	The only subset of \(\emptyset\) is \(\emptyset\), and we have \(\#(\emptyset) = 0 = \#(\emptyset)\).
	So the base case holds.
	Suppose inductively that for some \(\#(X) = n\), we have ``\(Y \subseteq X\) implies \(Y\) is finite and \(\#(Y) \leq \#(X)\)''.
	We want to show that when \(\#(X) = n\pp\), we have ``\(Y \subseteq X\) implies \(Y\) is finite and \(\#(Y) \leq \#(X)\)''.
	So let \(X\) be a set with cardinality \(n\pp\).
	Let \(Y \subseteq X\) and let \(z \in X\).
	We split into two cases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If \(z \in Y\), then we have \(Y \setminus \set{z} \subseteq X \setminus \set{z}\).
		      By \cref{3.6.9} we know that \(\#(X \setminus \set{z}) = n\).
		      Thus we can use induction hypothesis to derive \(Y \setminus \set{z}\) is finite and \(\#(Y \setminus \set{z}) \leq \#(X \setminus \set{z})\).
		      By \cref{3.1.28}(g) we have \(Y = (Y \setminus \set{z}) \cup \set{z}\), thus by \cref{3.6.14}(a) we know that \(Y\) is finite.
		      Therefore we have
		      \begin{align*}
			      \#(Y) & = \#((Y \setminus \set{z}) \cup \set{z}) &  & \by{3.1.28}[g] \\
			            & = \#(Y \setminus \set{z}) + 1            &  & \by{3.6.14}[a] \\
			            & \leq \#(X \setminus \set{z}) + 1         &  & \by{2.2.12}[d] \\
			            & = \#((X \setminus \set{z}) \cup \set{z}) &  & \by{3.6.14}[a] \\
			            & = \#(X).                                 &  & \by{3.1.28}[g]
		      \end{align*}
		\item If \(z \notin Y\), then we have \(Y \subseteq X \setminus \set{z}\).
		      By \cref{3.6.9} we know that \(\#(X \setminus \set{z}) = n\).
		      Thus we can use induction hypothesis to derive \(Y\) is finite and \(\#(Y) \leq \#(X \setminus \set{z})\).
		      Then we have
		      \begin{align*}
			      \#(Y) & \leq \#(X \setminus \set{z})             &  & \byIH          \\
			            & < \#(X \setminus \set{z}) + 1            &  & \by{ac:2.2.3}  \\
			            & = \#((X \setminus \set{z}) \cup \set{z}) &  & \by{3.6.14}[a] \\
			            & = \#(X).                                 &  & \by{3.1.28}[g]
		      \end{align*}
	\end{itemize}
	From all cases above we conclude that \(Y\) is finite and \(\#(Y) \leq \#(X)\).
	This closes the induction.

	Now suppose that \(Y \neq X\).
	Then we know that \(X \setminus Y \neq \emptyset\).
	Since \(X \setminus Y \subseteq X\), from first part of the proof we know that \(X \setminus Y\) is finite.
	Thus by \cref{ex:3.6.2} we have \(X \setminus Y \neq \emptyset \iff \#(X \setminus Y) > 0\).
	Since
	\begin{align*}
		\#(X) & = \#(Y \cup (X \setminus Y)) &  & \by{3.1.28}[g] \\
		      & = \#(Y) + \#(X \setminus Y), &  & \by{3.6.14}[b]
	\end{align*}
	by \cref{2.2.12}(f) we have \(\#(Y) < \#(X)\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[\pf{3.6.14}(d)]
	Since \(X\) is finite, by \cref{3.6.10} there exists an \(n \in \N\) such that \(\#(X) = n\).
	We induct on \(n\) to show that \(\#(f(X))\) is finite and \(\#(f(X)) \leq \#(X)\).
	For \(n = 0\), we have
	\begin{align*}
		         & X = \emptyset         &  & \by{ex:3.6.2} \\
		\implies & f(X) = \emptyset      &  & \by{3.4.1}    \\
		\implies & \#(f(X)) = 0 = \#(X). &  & \by{ex:3.6.2}
	\end{align*}
	Thus the base case holds.
	Suppose inductively that \(f(X)\) is finite and \(\#(f(X)) \leq \#(X)\) for some \(\#(X) = n\).
	We show that the statement is still true when \(\#(X) = n\pp\).
	So let \(X\) be a set with cardinality \(n\pp\).
	Let \(x \in X\).
	By \cref{3.6.9} we have \(\#(X \setminus \set{x}) = n\).
	Thus we can use induction hypothesis to derive ``\(f(X \setminus \set{x})\) is finite and \(\#(f(X \setminus \set{x})) \leq \#(X \setminus \set{x})\)''.
	Now we split into two cases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If \(f(X \setminus \set{x}) = f(X)\), then \(f(X)\) is finite and we have
		      \begin{align*}
			      \#(f(X)) & = \#(f(X \setminus \set{x}))                                 \\
			               & \leq \#(X \setminus \set{x})             &  & \byIH          \\
			               & < \#(X \setminus \set{x}) + 1            &  & \by{ac:2.2.3}  \\
			               & = \#((X \setminus \set{x}) \cup \set{x}) &  & \by{3.6.14}[a] \\
			               & = \#(X).                                 &  & \by{3.1.28}[g]
		      \end{align*}
		\item If \(f(X \setminus \set{x}) \neq f(X)\), then by \cref{ex:3.4.3,3.6.14}(a) we know that \(f(X) = f(X \setminus \set{x}) \cup \set{f(x)}\) is finite.
		      Thus
		      \begin{align*}
			      \#(f(X)) & = \#(f(X \setminus \set{x}) \cup \set{f(x)}) &  & \by{ex:3.4.3}                \\
			               & = \#(f(X \setminus \set{x})) + 1             &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(a))} \\
			               & \leq \#(X \setminus \set{x}) + 1             &  & \byIH                        \\
			               & = \#((X \setminus \set{x}) \cup \set{x})     &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(a))} \\
			               & = \#(X).                                     &  & \text{(by \cref{3.1.28}(g))}
		      \end{align*}
	\end{itemize}
	From all cases above we conclude that \(f(X)\) is finite and \(\#(f(X)) \leq \#(X)\).
	This closes the induction.

	Now suppose that \(f\) is injective.
	Define \(g : X \to f(X)\) as follow:
	\[
		\forall x \in X, g(x) = f(x).
	\]
	Since \(f\) is a function, \(g\) is well-defined.
	By \cref{3.4.1} we know that \(g\) is surjective.
	Since \(f\) is injective, by \cref{3.3.14} we know that
	\[
		\forall x_1, x_2 \in X, x_1 \neq x_2 \implies g(x_1) = f(x_1) \neq f(x_2) = g(x_2).
	\]
	Thus \(g\) is injective.
	By \cref{3.3.20} this means \(g\) is bijective.
	Therefore by \cref{3.6.1} \(X\) and \(f(X)\) have the same cardinality.
	From first part of the proof we know that \(f(X)\) is finite.
	Thus by \cref{3.6.10} we have \(\#(f(X)) = \#(X)\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[\pf{3.6.14}(e)]
	We first show that for any object \(x\), \(\set{x} \times Y\) is finite and \(\#(\set{x} \times Y) = \#(Y)\).
	Define \(f : \set{x} \times Y \to Y\) as follow:
	\[
		\forall (z, y) \in \set{x} \times Y, f(z, y) = y.
	\]
	By \cref{ex:3.5.7} we see that \(f = \pi_{\set{x} \times Y \to Y}\).
	We claim that \(f\) is injective.
	Let \((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \in \set{x} \times Y\) and \((x_1, y_1) \neq (x_2, y_2)\).
	Since
	\begin{align*}
		         & \begin{dcases}
			           (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \in \set{x} \times Y \\
			           (x_1, y_1) \neq (x_2, y_2)
		           \end{dcases}    \\
		\implies & \begin{dcases}
			           x_1, x_2 \in \set{x} \\
			           (x_1 \neq x_2) \lor (y_1 \neq y_2)
		           \end{dcases}             &  & \by{3.5.1,3.5.4} \\
		\implies & \begin{dcases}
			           x_1 = x_2 = x \\
			           (x_1 \neq x_2) \lor (y_1 \neq y_2)
		           \end{dcases}             &  & \by{3.3}         \\
		\implies & y_1 \neq y_2                                   \\
		\implies & y_1 = f(x_1, y_1) \neq f(x_2, y_2) = y_2,
	\end{align*}
	by \cref{3.3.14} we see that \(f\) is injective.
	Now we show that \(f\) is surjective.
	Let \(y \in Y\).
	Then we have
	\begin{align*}
		         & \begin{dcases}
			           x \in \set{x} \\
			           y \in Y
		           \end{dcases}            &  & \by{3.3}       \\
		\implies & (x, y) \in \set{x} \times Y &  & \by{3.5.4} \\
		\implies & f(x, y) = y.
	\end{align*}
	Thus by \cref{3.3.17} we see that \(f\) is surjective.
	Since \(f\) is both injective and surjective, by \cref{3.3.20} we know that \(f\) is bijective.
	Thus by \cref{3.6.1} \(\set{x} \times Y\) and \(Y\) have the same cardinality.
	Since \(Y\) is finite, by \cref{3.6.4} we know that \(\set{x} \times Y\) is also finite.
	Thus by \cref{3.6.10} we have \(\#(\set{x} \times Y) = \#(Y)\).

	Now we show that \(X \times Y\) is finite and \(\#(X \times Y) = \#(X) \times \#(Y)\).
	By \cref{3.6.10} there exists an \(n \in \N\) such that \(\#(X) = n\).
	We induct on \(n\) to show that \(X \times Y\) is finite and \(\#(X \times Y) = \#(X) \times \#(Y)\).
	For \(n = 0\), by \cref{ex:3.6.2} we have \(X = \emptyset\).
	Thus by \cref{3.5.4} we have \(\emptyset \times Y = \emptyset\) and therefore \(\emptyset \times Y\) is finite.
	Then we have
	\begin{align*}
		\#(\emptyset \times Y) & = \#(\emptyset)               &  & \by{3.5.4}    \\
		                       & = 0                           &  & \by{ex:3.6.2} \\
		                       & = 0 \times \#(Y)              &  & \by{2.3.1}    \\
		                       & = \#(\emptyset) \times \#(Y). &  & \by{ex:3.6.2}
	\end{align*}
	Thus the base case holds.
	Suppose inductively that \(X \times Y\) is finite and \(\#(X \times Y) = \#(X) \times \#(Y)\) for some \(\#(X) = n\).
	We show that the statement is still true for \(\#(X) = n\pp\).
	So let \(X\) be a set with cardinality \(n\pp\).
	Let \(x \in X\).
	By \cref{3.6.9} we have \(\#(X \setminus \set{x}) = n\).
	Thus by induction hypothesis we know that \((X \setminus \set{x}) \times Y\) is finite.
	From first part of the proof we know that \(\set{x} \times Y\) is finite.
	Since
	\begin{align*}
		X \times Y & = ((X \setminus \set{x}) \cup \set{x}) \times Y             &  & \by{3.1.28}[g] \\
		           & = ((X \setminus \set{x}) \times Y) \cup (\set{x} \times Y), &  & \by{ex:3.5.4}
	\end{align*}
	by \cref{3.6.14}(b) we know that \(X \times Y\) is finite.
	Thus we have
	\begin{align*}
		\#(X \times Y) & = \#(((X \setminus \set{x}) \times Y) \cup (\set{x} \times Y)) &  & \by{ex:3.5.4}                \\

	\end{align*}
	This closes the induction.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[\pf{3.6.14}(f)]
	We first show that \(Y^{\set{x}}\) is finite and \(\#\pa{Y^{\set{x}}} = \#(Y)\) for any object \(x\).
	Define \(f : Y^{\set{x}} \to Y\) as follow:
	\[
		\forall g \in Y^{\set{x}}, f(g) = g(x).
	\]
	Since \(g \in Y^{\set{x}}\) implies \(g(x)\) is an unique object defined in \(Y\), we know that \(f(g)\) passes the vertical line test.
	Thus by \cref{3.3.1} \(f\) is well-defined.
	We now show that \(f\) is bijective.
	We start by showing \(f\) is injective.
	Let \(g_1, g_2 \in Y^{\set{x}}\) and \(g_1 \neq g_2\).
	Since
	\begin{align*}
		         & g_1 \neq g_2                                               \\
		\implies & \exists z \in \set{x} : g_1(z) \neq g_2(z) &  & \by{3.3.7} \\
		\implies & g_1(x) \neq g_2(x)                         &  & \by{3.3}   \\
		\implies & g_1(x) = f(g_1) \neq f(g_2) = g_2(x),
	\end{align*}
	by \cref{3.3.14} we see that \(f\) is injective.
	Now we show that \(f\) is surjective.
	Let \(y \in Y\).
	Let \(g : \set{x} \to Y\) be defined by \(g(x) = y\).
	By \cref{3.10} we know that \(g \in Y^{\set{x}}\).
	Therefore \(f(g) = y\).
	By \cref{3.3.17} we see that \(f\) is surjective.
	Since \(f\) is both injective and surjective, by \cref{3.3.20} we know that \(f\) is bijective.
	Thus by \cref{3.6.1} \(Y^{\set{x}}\) and \(Y\) have the same cardinality.
	Since \(Y\) is finite, by \cref{3.6.10} we know that \(Y^{\set{x}}\) is finite, and we have \(\#\pa{Y^{\set{x}}} = \#(Y)\).

	Now we show that \(Y^X\) is finite and \(\#\pa{Y^X} = \#(Y)^{\#(X)}\).
	By \cref{3.6.10} there exists an \(n \in \N\) such that \(\#(X) = n\).
	We induct on \(n\) to show that \(Y^X\) is finite and \(\#\pa{Y^X} = \#(Y)^{\#(X)}\).
	For \(n = 0\), by \cref{ex:3.6.2} we have \(X = \emptyset\).
	By \cref{3.3.9} there is only one function in \(Y^\emptyset\), thus by \cref{3.3} \(Y^\emptyset\) is a singleton set and therefore \(Y^\emptyset\) is finite.
	By \cref{3.6.10} we have \(\#\pa{Y^\emptyset} = 1\), thus
	\begin{align*}
		\#(Y)^{\#(\emptyset)} & = \#(Y)^0             &  & \by{ex:3.6.2} \\
		                      & = 1                   &  & \by{2.3.11}   \\
		                      & = \#\pa{Y^\emptyset}. &  & \by{3.6.10}
	\end{align*}
	So the base case holds.

	Suppose inductively that the statement is true for some \(\#(X) = n\).
	We show that the statement is still true for \(\#(X) = n\pp\).
	So let \(X\) be a set with cardinality \(n\pp\).
	Let \(x \in X\).
	If \(f \in Y^X\), then we define two functions \(f_1 : X \setminus \set{x} \to Y\) and \(f_2 : \set{x} \to Y\) as follow:
	\[
		\forall z \in X \setminus \set{x}, f_1(z) = f(z) \quad \text{and} \quad \forall z \in \set{x}, f_2(z) = f(z).
	\]
	Since \(f\) is a function, we know that \(f_1, f_2\) are well-defined and unique to \(f\).
	Now we define \(h : Y^X \to Y^{X \setminus \set{x}} \times Y^{\set{x}}\) as follow:
	\[
		\forall f \in Y^X : h(f) = (f_1, f_2).
	\]
	Since \(f_1, f_2\) are unique to \(f\), we know that \(h\) is well-defined.
	We claim that \(h\) is bijective.
	We start by showing \(h\) is injective.
	So let \(f, g \in Y^X\) and \(f \neq g\).
	Since
	\begin{align*}
		         & f \neq g                                                                                                           \\
		\implies & \exists z \in X : f(z) \neq g(z)                                                                   &  & \by{3.3.7} \\
		\implies & (\exists z \in X \setminus \set{x} : f(z) \neq g(z)) \lor (\exists z \in \set{x} : f(z) \neq g(z))                 \\
		\implies & (f_1 \neq g_1) \lor (f_2 \neq g_2)                                                                 &  & \by{3.3.7} \\
		\implies & (f_1, f_2) \neq (g_1, g_2)                                                                         &  & \by{3.5.1} \\
		\implies & h(f) \neq h(g),
	\end{align*}
	by \cref{3.3.14} we see that \(h\) is injective.
	Now we show that \(h\) is surjective.
	Let \(p \in Y^{X \setminus \set{x}}\) and let \(q \in Y^{\set{x}}\).
	Define \(f : X \to Y\) as follow:
	\[
		\forall z \in X : f(z) = \begin{dcases}
			p(z) & \text{if } z \in X \setminus \set{x} \\
			q(z) & \text{if } z \in \set{x}
		\end{dcases}
	\]
	Since \(p, q\) are functions, we know that \(f\) is well-defined and thus \(f \in Y^X\).
	Since
	\begin{align*}
		         & \begin{dcases}
			           \forall z \in X \setminus \set{x}, f_1(z) = f(z) = p(z) \\
			           \forall z \in \set{x}, f_2(z) = f(z) = q(z)
		           \end{dcases}                    \\
		\implies & (f_1 = p) \land (f_2 = q)                                  &  & \by{3.3.7} \\
		\implies & (f_1, f_2) = (p, q)                                        &  & \by{3.5.1} \\
		\implies & h(f) = (p, q),
	\end{align*}
	by \cref{3.3.17} we see that \(h\) is surjective.
	Since \(h\) is both injective and surjective, by \cref{3.3.20} we know that \(h\) is bijective.
	Thus by \cref{3.6.1} we know that \(Y^X\) and \(Y^{X \setminus \set{x}} \times Y^{\set{x}}\) have equal cardinality.
	By \cref{3.6.9} we know that \(\#(X \setminus \set{x}) = n\).
	Thus by induction hypothesis we know that \(Y^{X \setminus \set{x}}\) is finite.
	From the first part of the proof we know that \(Y^{\set{x}}\) is finite.
	Thus by \cref{3.6.14}(e) we know that \(Y^{X \setminus \set{x}} \times Y^{\set{x}}\) is finite.
	By \cref{3.6.10} this means \(Y^X\) is finite and we have \(\#\pa{Y^X} = \#\pa{Y^{X \setminus \set{x}} \times Y^{\set{x}}}\).
	We now finish our induction as follow:
	\begin{align*}
		\#\pa{Y^X} & = \#\pa{Y^{X \setminus \set{x}} \times Y^{\set{x}}}         &  & \text{(from the proof above)}             \\
		           & = \#\pa{Y^{X \setminus \set{x}}} \times \#\pa{Y^{\set{x}}}  &  & \by{3.6.14}[e]                            \\
		           & = \#(Y)^{\#(X \setminus \set{x})} \times \#\pa{Y^{\set{x}}} &  & \byIH                                     \\
		           & = \#(Y)^{\#(X \setminus \set{x})} \times \#(Y)              &  & \text{(from the first part of the proof)} \\
		           & = \#(Y)^{\#(X \setminus \set{x}) + 1}                       &  & \by{2.3.11}                               \\
		           & = \#(Y)^{\#((X \setminus \set{x}) \cup \set{x})}            &  & \by{3.6.14}[a]                            \\
		           & = \#(Y)^{\#(X)}.                                            &  & \by{3.1.28}[g]
	\end{align*}
	This closes the induction.

\begin{rmk}\label{3.6.15}
	\cref{3.6.14} suggests that there is another way to define the arithmetic operations of natural numbers;
	not defined recursively as in \cref{2.2.1,2.3.1,2.3.11}, but instead using the notions of union, Cartesian product, and power set.
	This is the basis of \emph{cardinal arithmetic}, which is an alternative foundation to arithmetic than the Peano arithmetic we have developed here;
	we will not develop this arithmetic in this text, but we give some examples of how one would work with this arithmetic in \cref{ex:3.6.5,ex:3.6.6}.

	Show that a set \(X\) has cardinality \(0\) iff \(X\) is the empty set.
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}[\pf{ex:3.6.2}]
	By \cref{3.6.5} we know that \(\#(X) = 0\) iff there exists a bijective function \(f : X \to \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq 0}\).
	Since \(\set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq 0} = \emptyset\), by \cref{ex:3.3.3} we know that \(f\) is a bijective function iff \(X = \emptyset\).
	Thus we have \(\#(X) = 0\) iff \(X = \emptyset\).
\end{proof}

	Thus finite subsets of the natural numbers are bounded.
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}[\pf{ex:3.6.3}]
	We induct on \(n\) to show that for any function \(f : \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n} \to \N\), \(\exists M \in \N\) such that \(f(i) \leq M\).
	For \(n = 0\), for any function \(f : \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq 0} \to \N\) we have
	\begin{align*}
		         & f : \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq 0} \to \N                                           \\

		\implies & \forall M \in \N, \forall i \in \emptyset : f(i) \leq M. &  & \text{(trivially true)} \\
	\end{align*}
	Thus the base case holds.
	Suppose inductively that for some \(n\) the statement is true.
	Then for \(n\pp\), for any function \(f : \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n\pp} \to \N\) we have
	\begin{itemize}
		\item By induction hypothesis, \(\exists M \in \N\) such that \(f(\set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n}) \leq M\).
		\item By \cref{2.2.13}, exactly one of \(M < f(n\pp)\), \(M = f(n\pp)\) or \(M > f(n\pp)\) is true.
	\end{itemize}
	If \(f(n\pp) \leq M\), then we have \(\forall i \in \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n\pp} : f(i) \leq M\).
	If \(f(n\pp) > M\), then we can set \(M' = f(n\pp)\) and thus \(\forall i \in \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n\pp} : f(i) \leq M'\).
	In all cases above we can conclude that \(\exists M \in \N\) such that \(\forall i \in \set{i \in \N : 1 \leq i \leq n\pp} : f(i) \leq M\).
	This closes the induction.

	Then use \cref{3.6.14} to conclude an alternate proof of \cref{2.3.2}.
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}[\pf{ex:3.6.5}]
	Suppose that \(A, B\) are sets.
	By \cref{3.5.4} we have \(A \times B, B \times A\) are sets.
	We define a function \(f : A \times B \to B \times A\) by setting \(\forall (a, b) \in A \times B : f(a, b) = (b, a)\).
	We now show that such \(f\) is bijective.
	We start by showing \(f\) is injective.
	\begin{align*}
		         & \forall (a, b), (a', b') \in A \times B : f(a, b) = f(a', b')                 \\
		\implies & (b, a) = (b', a')                                                             \\

	\end{align*}
	Thus \(f\) is injective.
	Now we show that \(f\) is surjective.
	This is true since
	\[
		\forall (b, a) \in B \times A, \exists (a, b) \in A \times B : f(a, b) = (b, a).
	\]
	Thus \(f\) is surjective.
	Since \(f\) is both injective and surjective, we conclude that \(f\) is bijective.
	Since \(f\) is bijective, by \cref{3.6.1} we conclude that \(A \times B\) and \(B \times A\) have same cardinality.

	Now suppose that \(A, B\) are two finite set.
	By \cref{3.6.5}, \(\exists n, m \in \N\) such that \(\#(A) = n \land \#(B) = m\).
	Then we have

		\#(A \times B) & = \#(A) \times \#(B) &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(e))} \\
		               & = n \times m                                           \\

	Conclude that \((a^b)^c = a^{bc}\) for any natural numbers \(a, b, c\).
	Use a similar argument to also conclude \(a^b \times a^c = a^{b+c}\).
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}[\pf{ex:3.6.6}]
	We first show that \((A^B)^C\) and \(A^{B \times C}\) have equal cardinality.
	Suppose that \(A, B, C\) are sets.
	By \cref{3.5.4}, \(B \times C\) is a set.
	By \cref{3.10} \(A^B, (A^B)^C, A^{B \times C}\) are sets.
	We define a function \(f : (A^B)^C \to A^{B \times C}\) by setting \(\big(f(g)\big)(b, c) = \big(g(c)\big)(b)\) where \(b \in B\), \(c \in C\) and \(g : C \to A^B\).
	We now show that \(f\) is bijective.
	We start by showing that \(f\) is injective.
	\begin{align*}
		         & \forall h, h' \in (A^B)^C : f(h) = f(h')                                                     \\
		\implies & \forall (b, c) \in B \times C : \big(f(h)\big)(b, c) = \big(f(h')\big)(b, c) &  & \by{3.3.7} \\
		\implies & \forall (b, c) \in B \times C : \big(h(c)\big)(b) = \big(h'(c)\big)(b)                       \\
		\implies & \forall c \in C : h(c) = h'(c)                                               &  & \by{3.3.7} \\

	\end{align*}
	Thus \(f\) is injective.
	We now show that \(f\) is surjective.
	\(\forall h \in A^{B \times C}\), we define a function \(k : C \to A^B\) by setting \(h(b, c) = (k(c))(b)\) where \(b \in B\) and \(c \in C\).
	Then \(k \in (A^B)^C\) and thus \(f\) is surjective.
	Since \(f\) is both injective and surjective, we conclude that \(f\) is bijective.
	Since \(f\) is bijective, by \cref{3.6.1} we conclude that \((A^B)^C\) and \(A^{B \times C}\) have same cardinality.

	Now we show that \(\forall a, b, c \in \N : (a^b)^c = a^{bc}\).
	Suppose that \(A, B, C\) are finite set.
	By \cref{3.6.5}, \(\exists a, b, c \in \N\) such that \(\#(A) = a \land \#(B) = b \land \#(C) = c\).
	Then we have
	\begin{align*}
		\#((A^B)^C) & = \#(A^B)^{\#(C)}            &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(f))} \\
		            & = \#(A^B)^c                                                    \\
		            & = (\#(A)^{\#(B)})^c          &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(f))} \\
		            & = (a^b)^c                                                      \\
		            & = \#(A^{B \times C})         &  & \text{(by proof above)}      \\
		            & = \#(A)^{\#(B \times C)}     &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(f))} \\
		            & = \#(A)^{\#(B) \times \#(C)} &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(e))} \\
		            & = a^{bc}.
	\end{align*}
	Thus we conclude that \(\forall a, b, c \in \N : (a^b)^c = a^{bc}\).

	Next we show that \(A^B \times A^C\) and \(A^{B \cup C}\) have equal cardinality if \(B \cap C = \emptyset\).
	Now suppose that \(A, B, C\) are sets where \(B \cap C = \emptyset\).
	By \cref{3.10} \(A^B, A^C, A^{B \cup C}\) are sets.
	By \cref{3.5.4}, \(A^B \times A^C\) is a set.
	We define a function \(f : A^B \times A^C \to A^{B \cup C}\) by setting
	\[
		f(g, h)(x) = \begin{dcases}
			g(x) & \text{if } x \in B \\
			h(x) & \text{if } x \in C
		\end{dcases}
	\]
	where \(x \in B \cup C\), \(g : B \to A\) and \(h : C \to A\).
	We now show that \(f\) is bijective.
	We start by showing that \(f\) is injective.
	\begin{align*}
		         & \forall (g, h), (g', h') \in A^B \times A^C : f(g, h) = f(g', h')                 \\
		\implies & \forall x \in B \cup C : f(g, h)(x) = f(g', h')(x)                &  & \by{3.3.7} \\
		\implies & (\forall x \in B : f(g, h)(x) = f(g', h')(x))                                     \\
		         & \land (\forall x \in C : f(g, h)(x) = f(g', h')(x))               &  & \by{3.4}   \\
		\implies & (\forall x \in B : g(x) = g'(x))                                                  \\
		         & \land (\forall x \in C : h(x) = h'(x))                                            \\
		\implies & g = g' \land h = h'                                               &  & \by{3.3.7} \\
		\implies & (g, h) = (g', h').                                                &  & \by{3.5.1}
	\end{align*}
	Thus \(f\) is injective.
	We now show that \(f\) is surjective.
	\(\forall k \in A^{B \cup C}\), we define functions \(g : B \to A\) and \(h : C \to A\) by setting
	\[
		k(x) = \begin{dcases}
			g(x) & \text{if } x \in B \\
			h(x) & \text{if } x \in C
		\end{dcases}
	\]
	Since \(g \in A^B \land h \in A^C\), by \cref{3.5.4} we have \((g, h) \in A^B \times A^C\).
	Thus \(f\) is surjective.
	Since \(f\) is both injective and surjective, we conclude that \(f\) is bijective.
	Since \(f\) is bijective, by \cref{3.6.1} we conclude that \(A^B \times A^C\) and \(A^{B \cup C}\) have same cardinality.

	Now we show that \(\forall a, b, c \in \N : a^b \times a^c = a^{b + c}\).
	Suppose that \(A, B, C\) are finite set where \(B \cap C = \emptyset\).
	By \cref{3.6.5}, \(\exists a, b, c \in \N\) such that \(\#(A) = a \land \#(B) = b \land \#(C) = c\).
	Then we have
	\begin{align*}
		\#(A^B \times A^C) & = \#(A^B) \times \#(A^C)             &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(e))} \\
		                   & = \#(A)^{\#(B)} \times \#(A)^{\#(C)} &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(f))} \\
		                   & = a^b \times a^c                                                       \\
		                   & = \#(A^{B \cup C})                   &  & \text{(by proof above)}      \\
		                   & = \#(A)^{\#(B \cup C)}               &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(f))} \\
		                   & = \#(A)^{\#(B) + \#(C)}              &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(b))} \\
		                   & = a^{b + c}.
	\end{align*}
	Thus we conclude that \(\forall a, b, c \in \N : a^b \times a^c = a^{b + c}\).

\begin{ex}\label{ex:3.6.7}
	Let \(A\) and \(B\) be sets.

	\end{align*}
	Thus we conclude that if \(A, B\) are finite sets, then \(A\) has lesser or equal cardinality to \(B\) iff \(\#(A) \leq \#(B)\).
\end{proof}

\begin{ex}\label{ex:3.6.8}
	Let \(A\) and \(B\) be sets and \(A \neq \emptyset\) such that there exists an injection \(f : A \to B\) from \(A\) to \(B\) (i.e., \(A\) has lesser or equal cardinality to \(B\)).
	Show that there exists a surjection \(g : B \to A\) from \(B\) to \(A\).
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}[\pf{ex:3.6.8}]
	Suppose that \(A, B\) are sets, \(A \neq \emptyset\) and \(f : A \to B\) where \(f\) is injection.
	We now define a function \(g : B \to A\) as follow:
	\[
		\forall b \in B : \begin{dcases}
			g(b) \in A \setminus \set{a} & \text{if } b \in f(A \setminus \set{a}) \\
			g(b) = a                     & \text{if } b \notin f(A) \lor b = f(a)
		\end{dcases}
	\]
	where \(a \in A\) is a fixed value.
	We now show that \(g\) is surjective.
	\begin{align*}
		         & \forall a' \in A : (a' = a) \lor (a' \neq a)                                                            \\
		\implies & (\exists b \in B : b \notin f(A) \lor b = f(a'))       &  & \text{(\(a' = a \land f\) is injective)}    \\
		         & \lor (\exists b \in B : b \in f(A \setminus \set{a'})) &  & \text{(\(a' \neq a \land f\) is injective)} \\
		\implies & \exists b \in B : g(b) = a'.
	\end{align*}
	Thus \(g\) is surjective.
\end{proof}

\begin{ex}\label{ex:3.6.9}
	Let \(A\) and \(B\) be finite sets.
	Show that \(A \cup B\) and \(A \cap B\) are also finite sets, and that \(\#(A) + \#(B) = \#(A \cup B) + \#(A \cap B)\).
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}[\pf{ex:3.6.9}]
	Suppose that \(A, B\) are finite sets.
	By \cref{3.6.14}(b) we have \(A \cup B\) is finite.
	By \cref{ex:3.1.7} we have \(A \cap B \subseteq A\), and thus by \cref{3.6.14}(c) we have \(A \cup B\) is finite.
	By \cref{3.6.10} \(\exists n \in \N\) such that \(\#(A) = n\).
	We use induction on \(n\) to show that \(\#(A) + \#(B) = \#(A \cup B) + \#(A \cap B)\).
	For \(n = 0\), we have \(A = \emptyset\) and
	\begin{align*}
		\#(\emptyset) + \#(B) & = 0 + \#(B)                                    &  & \by{3.6.5}                   \\
		                      & = \#(B)                                                                          \\
		                      & = \#(\emptyset \cup B)                         &  & \text{(by \cref{3.1.28}(a))} \\
		                      & = \#(\emptyset \cup B) + 0                                                       \\
		                      & = \#(\emptyset \cup B) + \#(\emptyset)         &  & \by{3.6.5}                   \\
		                      & = \#(\emptyset \cup B) + \#(\emptyset \cap B). &  & \text{(by \cref{3.1.28}(a))}
	\end{align*}
	Thus the base case holds.
	Suppose inductively that for some \(n\) the statement is true.
	We now show that for \(n\pp\) the statement is also true.
	Since \(\#(A) = n\pp\), By \cref{3.6.8} we must have \(A \neq \emptyset\).
	Let \(a \in A\).
	Then we have
	\begin{align*}
		 & \#(A) + \#(B)                                                                                                \\
		 & = \#((A \setminus \set{a}) \cup \set{a}) + \#(B)                           &  & \text{(by \cref{3.1.28}(g))} \\
		 & = \#(A \setminus \set{a}) + 1 + \#(B)                                      &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(a))} \\
		 & = \#((A \setminus \set{a}) \cup B) + \#((A \setminus \set{a}) \cap B) + 1. &  & \byIH
	\end{align*}
	We now divide into two cases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If \(a \in B\), then we have
		      \begin{align*}
			       & \#((A \setminus \set{a}) \cup B) + \#((A \setminus \set{a}) \cap B) + 1                                           \\
			       & = \#(A \cup B) + \#((A \setminus \set{a}) \cap B) + 1                                                             \\
			       & = \#(A \cup B) + \#(((A \setminus \set{a}) \cap B) \cup \set{a})                &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(a))} \\
			       & = \#(A \cup B) + \#(((A \setminus \set{a}) \cup \set{a}) \cap (B \cup \set{a})) &  & \text{(by \cref{3.1.28}(f))} \\
			       & = \#(A \cup B) + \#(A \cap B).                                                  &  & \text{(by \cref{3.1.28}(g))}
		      \end{align*}
		\item If \(a \notin B\), then we have
		      \begin{align*}
			       & \#((A \setminus \set{a}) \cup B) + \#((A \setminus \set{a}) \cap B) + 1                                   \\
			       & = \#((A \setminus \set{a}) \cup B) + \#(A \cap B) + 1                                                     \\
			       & = \#(((A \setminus \set{a}) \cup B) \cup \set{a}) + \#(A \cap B)        &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(a))} \\
			       & = \#(A \cup B) + \#(A \cap B).                                          &  & \text{(by \cref{3.1.28}(d))}
		      \end{align*}
	\end{itemize}
	From all cases above we have \(\#(A) + \#(B) = \#(A \cup B) + \#(A \cap B)\) and this closes the induction.
\end{proof}

\begin{ex}\label{ex:3.6.10}
	Let \(A_1, \dots, A_n\) be finite sets such that \(\#(\bigcup_{i \in \set{1, \dots, n}} A_i) > n\).
	Show that there exists \(i \in \set{1, \dots, n}\) such that \(\#(A_i) \geq 2\).
	(This is known as the \emph{pigeonhole principle}.)
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}[\pf{ex:3.6.10}]
	Suppose that \(n \in \N\), \(A_1, \dots, A_n\) are finite sets and \(\#(\bigcup_{i \in \set{1, \dots, n}} A_i) > n\).
	We use induction on \(n\) to show that \(\exists i \in \set{1, \dots, n} : \#(A_i) \geq 2\).
	We start with \(n = 1\) since for \(n = 0\) the statement is vacuously true.
	For \(n = 1\), we have
	\begin{align*}
		         & \#(\bigcup_{i \in \set{1, \dots, 1}} A_i) > 1                \\
		\implies & \#(A_1) > 1                                   &  & \by{3.11} \\
		\implies & \#(A_1) \geq 2.
	\end{align*}
	Thus the base case holds.
	Suppose inductively that for some \(n\) the statement is true.
	Then for \(n\pp\), we have
	\begin{align*}
		         & \#(\bigcup_{i \in \set{1, \dots, n\pp}} A_i) > n\pp                                                \\
		\implies & \#((\bigcup_{i \in \set{1, \dots, n}} A_i) \cup A_{n\pp}) > n\pp &  & \by{3.11}                    \\
		\implies & \#(\bigcup_{i \in \set{1, \dots, n}} A_i) + \#(A_{n\pp}) > n\pp. &  & \text{(by \cref{3.6.14}(b))}
	\end{align*}
	Now we split into three cases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If \(\#(A_{n\pp}) = 0\), then we have \(\#(\bigcup_{i \in \set{1, \dots, n}} A_i) > n\pp > n\).
		      By induction hypothesis, \(\exists i \in \set{1, \dots, n} : \#(A_i) \geq 2\).
		      Then we have \(\exists i \in \set{1, \dots, n\pp} : \#(A_i) \geq 2\).
		\item If \(\#(A_{n\pp}) = 1\), then we have \(\#(\bigcup_{i \in \set{1, \dots, n}} A_i) + 1 > n\pp\).
		      This means \(\#(\bigcup_{i \in \set{1, \dots, n}} A_i) > n\) and by induction hypothesis, \(\exists i \in \set{1, \dots, n} : \#(A_i) \geq 2\).
		      Then we have \(\exists i \in \set{1, \dots, n\pp} : \#(A_i) \geq 2\).
		\item If \(\#(A_{n\pp}) > 1\), then \(\#(A_{n\pp}) \geq 2\) and we have \(\exists i \in \set{1, \dots, n\pp} : \#(A_i) \geq 2\).
	\end{itemize}
	From all cases above we have \(\exists i \in \set{1, \dots, n\pp} : \#(A_i) \geq 2\).
	This closes the induction.
